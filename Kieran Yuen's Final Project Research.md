My desired topic is in the field of personal finance. I have a strong interest in this field from credit cards to investing to budgeting. I started searching in JSTOR to start to see what I could find on the topic. I came to realize it is a very broad and too general of a topic to search for "personal finance." So I narrowed it down to financial literacy. 


### Research paper #1
I found a research paper that is trying to see if there is a difference between genders when it comes to general topics in financial literacy. They focused on college students and it was a survey-based data collection. The econometric techniques they used were actually very similar to the methods we used in class. They used the logistic regression, chi-square test, cross-tabulations, ANOVA tests and other basic statistical methods. The article was trying to answer the questions of what differences in financial literacy knowledge exists between genders and what factors contribute to that difference in knowledge. In terms of being able to get fresh, new, updated data, I did find a database where the S&P 500 along with some other organizations take send surveys around the world to measure and compare financial literacy around the world (https://gflec.org/research/?type=data). But I think I will probably not be able to find "financial literacy" related data that is being generated on a regular-basis and is up-to-date which is what I need for this Econometrics project to be a success.

### Research paper #2
A second research paper related to personal finance is about financial literacy and how it relates to self-employment. It made posited a causal link between entrepreneurial activities and financial literacy. It has interesting data about saving behavior and asset accumulation but it is survey data which is quite hard for me to replicate in a short time. I will be adjusting my focus to finding the data first before searching in the academic journal databases as I need large amounts of data to accurately back up what I find.
